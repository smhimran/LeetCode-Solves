For each index, calculate the maximum height to its left, and maximum height to its right, store them in separate arrays named `left` and `right`. Traverse the array again and for each height, find the minimum height between its maximum left and maximum right. In other words, for each `height`<sub>i</sub>, find the minimum of `left`<sub>i</sub> and `right`<sub>i</sub>. The water trapped in this height will be the difference of this minimum of maximum height and current height.
